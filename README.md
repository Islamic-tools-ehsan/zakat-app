## 🚀 How This App Helps You

Calculating Zakat can often feel complex due to fluctuating gold prices, different types of assets, and specific livestock rules. This app simplifies that process into three easy steps:

### 1. Unified Wealth Assessment
Instead of manually calculating different assets, the app provides a streamlined interface for:
- **Cash & Savings:** Input your liquid bank balance and physical cash.
- **Precious Metals:** Input Gold and Silver in grams; the app handles the valuation.
- **Investment Assets:** Account for stocks and business inventory in one place.
- **Debt Deduction:** Automatically subtracts your immediate liabilities to find your true taxable wealth.

### 2. Precise Livestock Calculation
Livestock Zakat has specific "Nisab" (threshold) brackets that are hard to memorize. 
- Simply enter the count of your **Sheep, Goats, Cows, or Buffalo**.
- The app instantly tells you exactly how many animals are due (e.g., "1 Tabi'" or "2 Sheep") based on authentic Hadith brackets.

### 3. Instant Scriptural Verification
To give you peace of mind and spiritual confidence, the app doesn't just show numbers.
- **Evidence Popups:** For every calculation, you can click "View Evidence" to see the specific Quranic verse or Sahih Hadith that justifies that rule.
- **Educational:** It teaches the user *why* they are paying a certain amount, connecting the financial act to the Divine command.

## 🌍 Why It Is Essential for Muslims

- **Accuracy for the Ummah:** Avoids the risk of underpaying (which leaves the obligation unfulfilled) or overpaying (though a blessing, it's better to know the exact right amount).
- **Multi-Lingual Accessibility:** Available in **Arabic, Urdu, English, Turkish, Indonesian, and French**, making it accessible to Muslims from different cultural backgrounds in their native tongue.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Designed to be used on-the-go. Whether you are at the bank, at your farm, or at home, you can calculate your Zakat in seconds.
- **Privacy Focused:** Your financial data is processed locally on your device. We do not store your wealth details, ensuring your financial privacy (Amanah).
